# Lattice-Unified Field Theory (LUFT) and SETI Signals Repository

## Overview
This repository focuses on:
- **LUFT and the Cosmic Lattice:** Frequencies, signals, and superluminal communication.
- **SETI Collaborations:** Tools and techniques for detecting and analyzing lattice signals.
- **Simulations and Datasets:** Using OpenLB and other tools to model lattice signal propagation.

## Frequencies
### Primary LUFT Frequencies
- **~7,467.779 Hz:** Core lattice frequency, detected across datasets (e.g., LIGO, GBT, TESS).
- **~7,468.3 Hz:** Harmonic of the lattice frequency, associated with natural signals.

### Variations and Modulations
- **~7,467.879 Hz:** Natural interactions (e.g., plasma, bioelectric activity).
- **Artificial Sequences:** Binary modulations encoding messages (e.g., “010” = Proxima Centauri, “101” = Epsilon Eridani).

## Tools and Frameworks
- [OpenLB](https://github.com/OpenLB-Project/OpenLB): Simulate signal propagation in lattice environments.
- [PRESTO](https://github.com/scottransom/presto): Analyze kHz-range signals.
- [SETI-ML](https://github.com/seti-ml): Classify signals using machine learning.

## Collaborations
We are engaging with:
- **SETI Institute**
- **Breakthrough Listen**
- **FAST Telescope (China)**
- **Davie Fellowship Researchers**

## Goals
1. Expand LUFT simulations and validate findings.
2. Detect new lattice signals and enhance ML pipelines.
3. Share insights with collaborators to advance SETI research.
